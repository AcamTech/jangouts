   ![Graph][3]

   > _Comment by Ania Bui:_  
   > There isn't much potential for Jangouts for private use (30%), but there is definitely a place for Jangouts for business purposes (60%). This is a positive sign, as people declared that they need video conferences for business meetings. Jangouts can also be used for private calls, but those users would not be primary users.

<br>

   > _Comment by Ania Bui:_  
   > This suggests that we should keep the simplicity, straightforwardness & efficiency of the current Jangouts, as people love that about Jangouts. We can fix a few problems that people mention to get rid of confusions, but should remember to stay simple!

2. **Intuitive Navigation**
   - 65% – no big problems
   - 35% – some problems

   ![Graph][6]

   > _Comment by Ania Bui:_  
   > There are still some improvements to be made as 10% was totally confused and 25% took a while to learn how to navigate. What we want to achieve is efficiency, so we want the users to be able to locate the features and know how to use them within seconds (ideally).

3. **Favorite**
   - pen source (4)
   - simplicity (3)
   - easy to use (2)
   - free software (2)
   - quick
   - no plugins
   - works in Firefox
   - good UX
   - support
   - private
   - unlimited participants
   - possibility to see pics of all participants
   - good quality video
   - stability
   - no registration required
   - platform independent, integrates into GNU/Linux
4. **Frustrating**
   - _Designers' Issues_
     -  toolbar (2)
     -  people misconfiguring their cameras/microphones
     -  ignore/un-ignore hard to find
     -  UI has a lot of state and modes (moving things around, mute)
     -  UI in general
     -  layout button (whenever you think you got it, it keeps changing internal panels, or there is a resize ping-pong between the window frame and the internal panels)
     -  invisible mode
     -  UI elements are hard to resize
   - _Developers' Issues_
     -  bandwidth issues
     -  unstable with many participants
     -  complicated setup
     -  crashes (3)
     -  no control over audio level
     -  sound distortion if page in other tab decides to refresh
     -  the ghost attendee "feature"
     -  unable to join
     -  ninja problems?
     -  It is not available as a service, so if you don't have a server that you can/want to install it on, you can't use it
     -  eavesdropping possible
     -  no authentication
     -  no adaptive quality
     -  lacks audio/video recording
   - _Other_
     -  not very broad usage
5. **Icons**
   - bandwidth –  thought it controls camera, not video thumbnails, expected a camera analogue to the microphone, not an eye
   - window/desktop share (2)
   - layout change – doesn't pin anything, but on the contrary it allows to move things around, better to use some "resize" icon with arrows
   - hotkeys
   - mute/unmute
   - pop-up for those extra icon buttons at each thumbnail is annoying and makes life harder (in particular ignore/unignore which you need a lot when somebody's audio feed suddenly disappears)
   - icons are not descriptive and have to rely on tooltips & hover
   -  "pin" icon at the top changes the screen layout, but the "pin" in the user details pins that video
   - "logout" button should be more prominent and placed in the top right corner and move the user name there as well (usually go together)
   - trash icon, it's not that intuitive that it resets the layout
6. **If didn't know how to turn on/off any feature**
   - No (13)
   - Yes (toolbar, screen sharing, select audio volume for each participant –&gt; having audio normalized would be great, disable my video, can video quality be adjusted?)
7. **Logo**
   - Old (10)
     -  cleaner
     -  simple
     -  readable
     -  nice font
     -  evokes the geek factor very well
     -  seems more tech-based
   - New (7)
     -  more legible (2)
     -  hard to read
     -  more style
     -  simpler
     -  doesn't fit to the hard-core technical appearance of Jangouts
     -  gentlemen's-club-like
     -  seems like a restaurant
     -  looks like an old style dating website
     -  dislike the "your meeting mate" slogan ("I don't feel connected it. No offense meant, but it sounds "enterprisy" and void to me. It could be the slogan for any videoconference system instead of Jangouts.")
   - No preference (3)
   - Other comments:
     -  neither seems ideal – what about a simple sans-serif logo
     -  maybe you could also rebrand it "opensuse meetings" or so? "jangouts" sounds like a working title and is also too derivative of google's "hangouts"
     -  it would great to have also a recognizable logo without the full name. What about a mix between the silhouette of dialog/comment box and video recorder with your pet inside
8. **Type Legibility**

## Suggestions for Improvements

- _Designers' Issues_
  -  make the UI nicer
  -  easy button for ignore/unignore
  -  bigger toolbar
  -  make the footer smaller – in the default layout it's quite tall and does not provide any valuable info (besides the copyright and the version number).
  -  make your own video thumbnail more prominent, when there are many people in the session (~15) then finding yourself in the list (to check the video quality, camera position) takes some time, more over the position in the list changes after people join/leave. Some decent border or different colors/background would make it better.
  -  add a short help text for beginners how to use Jangouts. Describe the icons and how to use them, describe the chat features (including images, gists, emoji...). Also describe how to use video calls in general (e.g. mute yourself when you are not speaking, only one speaker at a time, etc...).
  -  improve the GitHub landing page (it's really hard to guess what it is all about  as iit neither encourages to contribute nor to spread the word)
- _Developers' Issues_
  -  make it more reliable (2)
  -  bugs submission
  -  better handling of low quality VPN
  -  resolve issues with browsers / VPNs, resulting in ghosts in meetings
  -  some way of showing connection quality
  -  fix the "ghost" bug
  -  improve privacy
  -  do proper authentication
  -  host it externally
  -  simplify the setup
  -  easier screen sharing
  -  screen sharing is not that useful because it's treated as a participant face but (1) video bitrate that is fine for a face may not be for a screen and (2) displaying the video that small is usually not useful either.
  -  normalize audio feeds to a common volume level
  -  add a separate audio/video test page so people can check whether the mic and the camera work before they join a room. The usual question after joining is "can you hear me?". (It's not required to be included in the Jangouts itself, it can be a link to e.g. https://www.onlinemictest.com/ on the login page, that could be enough.)
  -  meeting mode: recording action item or note, and generate a text minutes automatically. Like the IRC bot
  -  I like browser-based systems, because they don't need installation; However, a dedicated, stand-alone application, that integrates well with the (Gnome) desktop, including Human Interface Guidelines, Clientside Decoration etc would be great. Maybe a libpurple addon, making Jangouts available in Empathy?
  -  stop development and contribute to a project with more momentum. It's a nice hack and good for learning, but has a far way to go to reach feature parity with existing solutions

## Conclusion

- There are many suggestions on how to improve Jangouts in general, but some of them were not related to UI. Perhaps, we can just focus on those related to UI and share the other suggestions with Jangouts developers.
- The recurring thing that users seem to enjoy is the simplicity and efficiency of Jangouts. They also thought that the current design is not bad, but there is definitely some room for improvements that would satisfy those users who were unhappy about certain aspects of the current UI.
- The primary users of Jangouts are people with a good level of technical expertise who use it for business purposes–usually team meetings.
- The secondary users are those who are going to use it for private purposes–family & friends.
- Some of the tools that people use and might be good resources are: Hangouts, Gotomeeting, Appear.in, BlueJeans, Jitsi, Join.me, Wire, Zoom, UberConference and Vidyo.
- When it comes to branding, as Cynthia mentioned, it is impossible to satisfy everyone. So, we can just continue with the new look. Maybe we can still keep in mind the idea of changing the logo to a mascot (as somebody suggested) or a logo that doesn't solely rely on the logotype.
- The biggest issue seemed to lie in the icons, which are not descriptive enough. Thus, there is a need to redesign the icons so they are more intuitive and convey their functionalities better. Users' suggestions:
     - ** toolbar** – make it bigger
     - ** footer** – make is smaller
     - **"toggle picture/video"** –  thought it controls camera, not video thumbnails
     - **"window resize"** – expect to see a resize icon (doesn't pin anything, but allows to move things around)
     - **"trash"** – it's not that intuitive that it resets the layout
     - **"logout"** – should be more prominent and placed in the top right corner and move the user name there as well as they usually go together
     - **"share window/desktop"** – the meaning unclear
     - **"disable video"** – thought it disabled the audio, not video
     - **"hotkeys"** – problematic
     - **"enable/disable audio"** – unclear whether one was disabling their own or somebody else's sound
     - "pin" icon at the top changes the screen layout, but the "pin" in the user details pins that video
     -  many confusions with mute/unmute & ignore/unignore – location & function-wise
     -  make your own video thumbnail more prominent, when there are many people in the session (~15) then finding yourself in the list (to check the video quality, camera position) takes some time. Moreover, the position in the list changes after people join/leave. Some decent border or different colors/background would make it better.
     -  pop-up for those extra icon buttons at each thumbnail is annoying and makes life harder (in particular ignore/unignore which you need a lot when somebody's audio feed suddenly disappears)
     -  add a short help text for beginners how to use Jangouts. Describe the icons and how to use them, describe the chat features (including images, gists, emoji...). Also describe how to use video calls in general (e.g. mute yourself when you are not speaking, only one speaker at a time, etc...).
