# Redesign Documentation

## Summary

The first step to redesign Jangouts was to understand its users. Thus, we conducted an online [Survey][1] and created a few [Personas][2], profiles of fictional  users to represent different user types who use Jangouts. Having analyzed the [Results][3] of the survey, we matched the respondents to the personas to recognize the needs of specific types of users that are described in [Personas' Requirements][4]. Then, we specified the requirements for the new design in [UI Requirements Specification][5] and began designing wireframes. The [First Draft][6] shows 10 different ideas that were later narrowed down and explained in the [Wireframes Design Explanation][7] that lead to the [Second Draft][7]. This gave a foundation for the design of the Prototype that can be statically viewed [here][9] or interactively tested [here][10].
