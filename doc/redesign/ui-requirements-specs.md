# UI Requirements Specification

_Design Approaches to Meet Key Usability Requirementsâ€“5E's_

| Dimension | Key needs | Design tactics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Effective** | Accuracy | It is serving its purpose right now, but need to improve the design to make it more straightforward and less confusing. Users sometimes misinterpret certain functionalities and buttons. |
| **Efficient** | Operational speed | Keep it minimalistic as it is to avoid the instabilities with a greater number of participants in the room. |
| **Engaging** | Attract users | Add a more visually stimulating layout of the features, exploit the available color palette, fix typography and possibly redesign the logo so people become more connected to Jangouts more. |
| **Easy to learn** | Just-in-time instruction | Keep the simplicity, but improve the problems pointed out by the users. Perhaps make the layout and buttons more intuitive and add a guide for beginner that would walk them through Jangouts. Keep the current tooltip & hover descriptions. |
| **Error tolerant** | Validation | Can cancel quickly. No improvements needed. |

- Some of the tools that people use and might be good resources are: Hangouts, Gotomeeting, Appear.in, BlueJeans, Jitsi, Join.me, Wire, Zoom, UberConference and Vidyo.
- When it comes to branding, it is not an urgent matter and it is impossible to satisfy everyone. So, we can just continue with the new look. Maybe we can still keep in mind the idea of changing to a more graphic logo that doesn't solely rely on the logotype and will provide a fresh look while we work on improving the UI.
- It is important to identify the target as well. The users of Jangouts are technologically advanced and are open to new technologies. The primary users are those who need a videoconferencing tool for their team meetings. The secondary users are those who will use Jangouts for private purposes.
- The biggest issue seem to lie in the icons, which are not descriptive enough. Thus, there is a need to redesign the icons so they are more intuitive and convey their functionalities better. Icons that will have to be redesigned or/and repositioned:
  - "toggle picture/video"
  - "window resize"
  - "trash"
  - "logout"
  - "share window/desktop"
  - "disable video"
  - "hotkeys"
  - "enable/disable audio"
- "Pin" icon at the top that changes the screen layout & the "pin" in the user details will have to be differentiated.
- Mute/unmute and ignore/unignore will have to be differentiated both in terms of their look and location that is more intuitive for the users.
- Make the user's own video thumbnail more prominent.
- Make the "more options" in each thumbnail more obvious and easier to access. In particular, make it easier to ignore/unignore people in rooms with a greater number of participants.
- Add a brief intro for beginners on how to use Jangouts. Describe the icons, introduce available features and their placements.
- Rework the position of the logo, room name & user's name.
