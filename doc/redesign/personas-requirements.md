# Personas' Requirements

## Joffrey

- Jangouts basically does what it is supposed to do and it's simple in a positive way. Sometimes the experience is not too great when there are too many people in the room because the call becomes shaky and the audio and video don't always work.
- The favorite things about Jangouts are simplicity, support, the possibility to see all participants and the ability to organize the layout.
- The most frustrating things about Jangouts are unreliability with many participants, sound distortions when he is refreshing other pages and the small toolbar.

> _Comment by Cynthia D. Sanchez:_  
> This is a key point. We need to have an option to HIDE all video cameras or maybe another option to solve this problem.

- The icons are generally intuitive except for  "toggle picture/video" and "trash" icons.
- Joffrey uses Jangouts for both business and private meetings.
- His suggestions are to make Jangouts more reliable (audio and video) and fix the toolbar area.

## Jim

- Jangouts is an efficient tool.
- The favorite things about Jangouts are the quality of the videos and that it is a an open source and free software.

> _Comment by Cynthia D. Sanchez:_  
> Maybe for these kind of users it would be nice to have a footer or a link somewhere linking to the GitHub project.

- The most frustrating thing about Jangouts is that the UI makes the features confusing, making it hard to use the interface.

> _Comment by Cynthia D. Sanchez:_  
> Maybe we need to remove them all and replace them for text. This is not surprising to me, since most applications are going into that direction. Android 6 biggest change was exactly that, replacing the icons of "copy" and "paste" for actual text.

- The icons are weird and chaotic. In particular, "disable video", "toggle picture/video" and "window resize." Jim has to rely on the tooltips and hovers.
- Jim uses Jangouts for team meetings and might consider setting up a server on his own machine and communicate with his friends/family.
- His suggestions are to improve the UI, simplify the setup, provide a proper authentication, host it externally and fix the "ghost" bug.

## Sheldon

- Jangouts is a nice tool, but he doesn't use it too frequently.
- The favorite things about Jangouts are simplicity and ease of use, as there is no need to register. Also, it is platform independent and it's a free software.
- The most frustrating things about Jangouts are the toolbar and the audio level. The crashes are annoying and the "invisible" mode where you can see/hear others but they cannot see/hear you.

> _Comment by Cynthia D. Sanchez:_  
> Maybe we should ask developers to understand why they made such feature as "invisible" because I also don't see the point for that, as it makes it a bit unfair for the rest not to know that there is someone listening/viewing.

- The icons are not intuitive and he has to hover over to see the tooltip. In particular, window sharing buttons and the two different "pin" icons.
- Sheldon uses Jangouts mostly for team meetings where people are based in different places. If there was a private server, he might consider using it for private purposes.
- Some of his suggestions are: bugs submission feature, making one's video thumbnail more prominent as it gets lost with more participants, adding a separate audio/video test page, adding a "how to" guide where all icons are explained and reconsidering the screen sharing feature because of the quality.


## David
- Jangouts works for David, however, there are too many steps needed to set up and it involves an admin, which is not ideal.
- The favorite things about Jangouts are that it is an open source and free software. It is easy to use.
- The most frustrating things about Jangouts are initial setup, crashes, ignore/unignore and mute/unmute problems.
- The icons are intuitive, but it can be improved by making the buttons a little bit larger and clearer when it comes to their functionalities.
- David uses Jangouts only for team meetings within the company.
- Some suggestions are to have easier screen sharing, improve privacy and possibly add a "meeting mode," which would record the notes and text minutes automatically.

## Cartman

- Jangouts is a stable and basic tool.
- The favorite things about Jangouts are stability and that it's open source.
- The most frustrating things about Jangouts are the window resize behavior as it keeps changing internal panels. Also, it is eavesdropping possible, there is no authentication and no adaptive quality.

> _Comment by Cynthia D. Sanchez:_  
> I would agree with this. I think we should try with a tool that changes layouts, in 2 to 3 max different options, but it keeps the layout intact, so we don't give room for errors.

- The mute/unmute or ignore/unignore is unclear and having to go via a pop-up for those extra icon buttons at each thumbnail is annoying and makes life harder.

> _Comment by Cynthia D. Sanchez:_  
> We might want to add some key combinations for those actions, but still keep the pop-up menu for the rest.

- Cartman only uses Jangouts for team meetings.
- Some suggestions are to normalize audio feeds to a common volume level.
